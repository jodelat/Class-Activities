* **Folder**: `05-Titleize`

* **INSTRUCTIONS**:

  * Your task is to write tests for a function that title-cases incoming names. For example: `titleize('mr jones')` returns 'Mr Jones'.

  * **Bonus:** create a dictionary of titles, such as Dr; Mr; Ms; etc. If the string begins with such a title, capitalize it, and append a period.

  * Proceed as with `disemvowel`, considering:

    * What constitutes a "representative expected input"?

    * What is unexpected input? How do you want `titleize` to respond to this?

    * Do you want to allow arbitrarily long names, or impose a cutoff? _Hint_: There's no right answer, here. Choose an implementation, and write a test reflecting your choice.

  * Once you've written your tests, run them to ensure they fail.

  * Next, start implementing `titleize`. Pass one test at a time.

  * Once you've passed all tests, congratulate yourself! Be prepared to explain your tests to the rest of the class.
